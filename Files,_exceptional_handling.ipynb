        "##Theoritical Question\n",
        "\n",
        "#**************************************************\n",
        "##1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages/\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interpreted languages run line-by-line using an interpreter, so errors are found during execution. Compiled languages convert the whole program into machine code before running. Interpreted languages are usually slower but easier to test. Python is interpreted, while C and C++ are compiled.\n",
        "\n",
        "##2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exception handling is a method to manage errors during program execution. It prevents a program from crashing by catching errors using try and handling them using except. This helps the program continue running smoothly. It improves the reliability of software.\n",
        "\n",
        "##3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The finally block runs whether an exception occurs or not. It is mostly used for cleanup tasks such as closing files or releasing resources. This ensures that necessary steps are always completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "##4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Logging is a method to record events that happen while a program runs. Developers use it to track errors, warnings, or normal activities. It helps in debugging and monitoring applications in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "##5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- __del__ is a destructor method that automatically runs when an object is deleted. It helps free resources or close files before the object is removed from memory. Python calls it during garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "##6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- import module loads the whole module, and functions must be accessed using module.function. from module import function loads only specific items, allowing them to be used directly. The second method writes cleaner code.\n",
        "\n",
        "##7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multiple exceptions can be handled by using several except blocks. Each block handles a different type of error. We can also group exceptions in a tuple to handle multiple errors together.\n",
        "\n",
        "##8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The with statement automatically opens and closes files. It ensures that resources are released even if an error occurs. This makes file handling cleaner and safer.\n",
        "\n",
        "##9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory. Multiprocessing uses separate processes with separate memory spaces. Multiprocessing is better for CPU-heavy tasks, while multithreading suits I/O tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "##10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Logging helps track events, errors, and warnings in a structured way. It provides a permanent record for debugging and monitoring. Logs can be saved to files for later analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "##11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory management includes allocating and releasing memory automatically. Python uses a private heap and garbage collector to manage unused objects. It makes memory usage efficient and avoids leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "##12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- You place risky code inside a try block. Errors are caught in the except block. Optional else and finally blocks can run additional code as needed. This structure handles errors safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "##13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Good memory management ensures programs run efficiently without wasting memory. It prevents crashes caused by memory leaks. Python’s automatic garbage collector helps maintain stable performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "##14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The try block contains code that may cause errors. The except block handles those errors when they occur. This avoids sudden crashes and allows alternate actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "##15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python uses reference counting to track how many variables point to an object. When the count becomes zero, memory is freed. A cycle detector also collects circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "##16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It is used when you want certain code to run only after successful execution. It improves program structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "##17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Common logging levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. Each level shows the importance of the message. They help classify the severity of program events.\n",
        "\n",
        "##18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- os.fork() directly creates a child process but works only on Unix systems. The multiprocessing module is cross-platform and provides higher-level APIs. Multiprocessing is safer and easier to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "##19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Closing a file releases system resources. It ensures data is saved properly and avoids file corruption. Using with automatically closes the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "##20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire file as one string. file.readline() reads only one line at a time. The second one is more efficient for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "##21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The logging module is used to record events while a program runs. It helps save information like warnings, errors, or debug messages. It supports file logging and different log levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "##22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The os module helps interact with the operating system. It is used to check if files exist, remove files, create directories, or get file paths. It manages file-related operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "##23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python creates many temporary objects, which can increase memory usage. Circular references can delay garbage collection. Large data structures may consume high memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "##24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- We can manually raise an exception using the raise keyword. It is used when you want to force an error for invalid conditions. Example: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\").\n",
        "\n",
        "##25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multithreading helps programs run tasks simultaneously. It is useful for I/O-bound tasks like downloading files or reading network data. It improves performance and responsiveness.\n",
